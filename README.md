## Note to whoever is reading this

This side project is mainly a learning process to familiarize myself with Ruby as well as the Rails framework, as well as for general programming experience. For that
reason, the desktop and web application are the two main priorites. The mobile apps will likely end up being an excercise in Java (for the
Android version) and Swift (for the iOS version).
