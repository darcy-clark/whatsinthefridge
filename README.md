## Note to whoever is reading this

Among many other companies, I really want to get a coop job at Shopify for one of my terms, and I know they use Ruby and Rails quite a lot. This side project is mainly
a learning process to familiarize myself with Ruby as well as the Rails framework, as well as for general programming experience. For that
reason, the desktop and web application are the two main priorites. The mobile apps will likely end up being an excercise in Java (for the
Android version) and Swift (for the iOS version).
